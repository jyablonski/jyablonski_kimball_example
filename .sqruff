# # LT05 - line too long gahbage
# # RF01 - some dumbass shit about not using table aliases idk bruh
# # RFO2 - i do select a, b instead of foo.a, vee.b - bad habit but excluding for now
# # RF04 - no sql-reserved keywords as aliases - bad habit but excluding for now
# # ST07 - no `using` keyword for joins - this is fine imo so fuqqit
# # ST06 - Select wildcards then simple targets before calculations and aggregates.
# #      - this rule can literally break your sql so fuck that

# this just didnt work, the linux install borked w/ `Illegal instruction (core dumped)`
# and it's completely unclear why some of these are sqruff and some of the configs are
# sqlfluff still
